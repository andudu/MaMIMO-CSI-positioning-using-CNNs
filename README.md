# MaMIMO_CSI_with_CNN_positioning
This repository contains the source code used for the results in "CSI-based Positioning in Massive MIMO systems using Convolutional Neural Networks".


The data used in this project can be found at https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~sdebast/.
This website is still in early stages and more documentation about the measruments will be added in the near future.
